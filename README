-==// Copilot //==-

A restful API built to fill the role of a middle tier data access layer for TS Software and Services.


Roadmap
	
	PRE-ALPHA 	- non-functional
	ALPHA		- partly-functional
	BETA		- functional, pre-release
	v1.0		- functional, release


Licensing

Mod Rewrite

	If copilot is saying that your api is not found, make sure your http.conf defaults look like this.

		<Directory />
		    Options FollowSymLinks
		    AllowOverride All
		    Order deny,allow
		    Deny from all
		</Directory>


Sublime project files are setup to access C:\Program Files (x86)\Zend\Apache2\htdocs\copilot.
